# net_connection
Checking for a network connection from python script

# IMPORTANCE
While making software that uses internet connection [mostly in python] you obviously have to check if the internet connection is present.
If not you request the user to check their internet connection.

There are several ways to do this. I will cover as many as i can as soon as i find out more methods
So Far i have covered
